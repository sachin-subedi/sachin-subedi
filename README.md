# Hi, I'm Sachin Subedi 👋

PhD Candidate in **Bioinformatics** at the University of Georgia.  
I work at the intersection of **avian influenza, wild bird ecology, poultry health, and machine learning**.

🌐 Personal website: https://sachin-subedi.github.io/

## 🧪 What I work on

- **Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI H5Nx)**
  - Ecological and evolutionary drivers of cross-species and cross-border spread  
  - Bayesian phylodynamics & phylogeography (discrete traits, GLMs, Markov jumps/rewards)  
  - Integrating wild bird occurrence, poultry density, trade, and environmental covariates into reproducible analysis pipelines

- **Bioinformatics & AI for poultry health**
  - Deep learning and computer vision (YOLO, CNNs) for cage-free hen monitoring  
  - Automated detection of mis-laying, feather pecking, and floor-egg behavior  
  - Translating image- and sequence-based models into decision-support tools for animal health and welfare

## 🛠️ Tools & technologies

- **Languages:** R, Python, C++, Bash  
- **Bioinformatics & stats:** tidyverse, data.table, scikit-learn, PyTorch, mixed models, Bayesian modeling  
- **Phylodynamics & evolution:** BEAST / BEAST2, baltic, TreeAnnotator, LogCombiner  
- **Genomics / data wrangling:** FASTA/metadata processing, custom pipeline scripts  
- **GIS & spatial modeling:** sf, terra, raster, xarray, rioxarray  
- **Deep learning & CV:** PyTorch, torchvision, YOLO variants  
- **Reproducibility & HPC:** Git/GitHub, SLURM-based workflows, parameterized R/Python pipelines

## 📌 Current focus

- Ecological & evolutionary analysis of **2.3.4.4b H5Nx HPAI spread** 
- GLM-based and deep-learning models to **predict spillover risk** at fine spatial and temporal scales  
- Designing transparent, well-documented workflows so others can reuse and extend my code and analyses
