# Hi, I'm Sachin Subedi 👋

PhD Candidate in in Bioinformatics at the University of Georgia.  
I work at the intersection of **avian influenza, wild bird ecology, poultry health, and machine learning**.

🌐 Personal website: https://sachin-subedi.github.io/

---

## 🧪 What I work on

- **Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI H5Nx)**
  - Ecological and evolutionary drivers of cross-species and cross-border spread  
  - Phylogeographic & Bayesian phylodynamic models  
  - Integrating wild bird migration, poultry density, trade, and environmental data

- **AI for poultry welfare & production**
  - Deep learning and computer vision (YOLO, CNNs) for cage-free hen monitoring  
  - Automated detection of mis-laying, feather pecking, and floor egg behavior  
  - Tools to improve both animal welfare and farm management

---

## 🛠️ Tools & technologies

- **Languages:** R, Python, C++, Bash  
- **Stats / ML:** tidyverse, scikit-learn, PyTorch  
- **Phylodynamics:** BEAST / BEAST2, baltic, TreeAnnotator, LogCombiner  
- **GIS / spatial:** sf, terra, raster, xarray, rioxarray  
- **Deep learning & CV:** PyTorch, torchvision, YOLO variants  
- **Reproducibility:** Git, GitHub, SLURM on HPC clusters

---

## 📌 Current focus

- Ecological & evolutionary analysis of **2.3.4.4b H5Nx HPAI spread** across European habitats and “GeoClusters”
- GLM-based and deep-learning models to **predict spillover risk** at fine spatial and temporal scales
- Cleaning and documenting pipelines so others can build on my code and data workflows
